The run analysis script takes the original messy data.

Then it reads the .txt files to combine them into one "final" data frame

Then, it selects out the columns containing information about mean and standard deviations, using some text analysis. 

Finally, it creates a new tidy data set called "tidydata", by grouping the data frame with subject and activity; and them summarising across the means of the columns.
